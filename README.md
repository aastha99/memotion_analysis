This repository contains the code for the various models we developed to perform 2 separate classfications as a part of the project in the course Applied Deep Learning by Prof. Joshua Gordon at Columbia University. The first one was to classify memes into general, sarcastic and non-sarcastic categories while the other was to classify them into positive, negative and neutral categories.

For each of these classification taks, we developed 3 main models: A model using only images as input, a model using only text as input and a model using both meme images and meme text as input.
